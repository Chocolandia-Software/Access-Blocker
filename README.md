# Access-Blocker
A fully functioning tool to block access to the computer via a password. No need to lock!

# About
You know those times, when you need to get away from your PC/Laptop and want to block access to the computer, but you dont want to Lock it? That is when this tool comes in handy.

It is written in Python and uses the default Tkinter GUI Framework. It prevents you from closing in any way possible: Alt F4 doesn't work with it, it is full screen so no close buttons, it remains always on top, and it auto-closes the start menu if you try to open it. The only way to close it is to either enter the correct password or to just restart using the power button. 

# Interface
I am not actually that good with PySide or PyQT so you are encouraged to open a pull request to move Tk into Qt, because Tk is very basic.
